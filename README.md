## Setting up SSL
For this project, we choose to utilize OpenSSL for generating a self-signed certificate instead of implementing Let's Encrypt. Our choice was mainly based on the application being in the local development phase. Let's Encrypt offers free, automatic certificates but, it needs a live, accessible domain name for ownership verification.
